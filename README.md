# Project Title

## Description
This project consists of HTML and CSS files for a web interface. The HTML file represents the structure, while the CSS file styles the elements of the interface.

## Files Included

- `styles.css`: Includes the CSS styles for the web interface.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the web interface.

## Media Queries
The project includes media queries for two screen sizes:
- **1440px**: Adjusts styles for larger screens.
- **390px**: Adjusts styles for smaller screens.

## Project Structure
